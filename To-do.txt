TO-DO


PSEUDOCODE 

Legend:
V = version made
!!! = priority


GEOMETRY
    Create the pml!!!
    Define edges as PEC!!!
    Drude media masks Adder
    Create the mask

Update schemes!!!
    Define the fields!!!
        let us start with a 100 by 100 
    Define the update equations according to non-uniform yee fdtd!!!
    Idea add  TM Equations
    
    implement boundary conditions!!!

    possibility to look at other schemes

Plane wave sources
    Do this with the total-field/scattered-field method in chapter 5 read upon later!!!
    Side not we can replace phase velocity with can
    make it a gaussian pulse form 


    Add a frequency domain analysys

Visualisation
    do a time domain animation
    analytical solution for scattering from cylindrical PMC
    we can also analyse scattering at well chosen dielectric objects
